    <description>Proxifier allows network applications that do not support working through proxy servers to operate through a SOCKS or HTTPS proxy or a chain of proxy servers.
With Proxifier, you can easily tunnel all a system’s TCP connections or only those you select.
  
**Proxifier allows you to**
*   run any network application through a proxy server. The software requires no special configuration, and the entire process is completely transparent
*   access the internet from a restricted network through a proxy server gateway
*   bypass firewall restrictions
*   "tunnel" the entire system (force all network connections, including system connections, to work through a proxy server)
*   resolve DNS names through a proxy server
*   use flexible Proxification Rules with hostname and application name wildcards
*   ensure privacy by hiding your IP address
*   work through a chain of proxy servers using diverse protocols
*   view real-time information on current network activities (connections, hosts, times, bandwidth usage, etc.)
*   maintain log files and traffic dumps
*   get detailed reports on network errors
*   and much more!
**Specifications:**
*   Proxy protocols: SOCKS4, SOCKS4A, SOCKS5, HTTPS, and HTTP (HTTP connections only)
*   Authentication: SOCKS5 username/password authentication (RFC 1929), HTTP Basic, NTLM (including transparent mode), Kerberos
*   Full IPv6 support
*   Full 64-bit application and system support
*   Profile password encryption up to AES 256 bit
*   Windows 7/8/10, Server 2008/2012/2016/2019
*   [All features and specifications](../../features.html)</description>
