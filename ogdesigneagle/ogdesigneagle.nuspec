    <summary>Organize all your reference images in one place</summary>
    <description>Eagle helps you become a happier, better designer. A new way to collect, search and organize your image files in a logical way and all in one place.
## Why Eagle?
**Your solution to organizing design assets**
Eagle is your best choice for organizing images and ideas. Thousands of images? Hundreds of categories? Eagle solves it all with efficiency and style.

**It can be a fuss to collect images from websites**
Collecting images are always a nightmare, especially with all the procedures and when there are more than one.

**Lack of efficiency to organizing assets**
Organizing assets means creating many folders and multiple cut-and-paste actions, which can be quite a waste of time.

**Finding assets become mission impossible**
It is not easy to remember where you keep all your design assets, and it is harder to find the right one at the right time.</description>
